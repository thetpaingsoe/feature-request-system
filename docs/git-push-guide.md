# Git Push Guide
It is completely same with normal git.  
You just need to navigate the correct folder to do the commit and push.  

## Core ( feature-request-system )
When you update docs or docker-compose.yml, you just do normal commit and push.  

    git add .
    git commit -m "message"
    git push


## Backend
When you updated the backend files, you need to navigate to the backend folder. and do the commit and push.  
It will directly push to the [backend project](https://github.com/thetpaingsoe/feature-request-system-be).

    cd backend
    git add .
    git commit -m "message"
    git push

## Frontend
When you updated the frontend files, you need to navigate to the frontend folder. and do the commit and push.  
It will directly push to the [frontend project](https://github.com/thetpaingsoe/feature-request-system-fe).

    cd frontend
    git add .
    git commit -m "message"
    git push
