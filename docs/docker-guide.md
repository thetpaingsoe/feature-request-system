# Docker Guide
In this document, I will only explain about how to build the builder mode.  
For the development, please check this [Development Setup Guide](./docs/development-setup-guide.md)

## Prerequisites
1. Complete the [setup guide](./setup-guide.md)
2. Install Docker Desktop

    **Open Docker Desktop App**  
    Make sure you have enought space and
    **open** the docker desktop app.  
    https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

<br/>  

## For Builder Mode

### Build Image
For the builder mode, you don't need to change any thing.  
Just have to run the following command.  

    docker-compose up --build

After you run above command, you will see `start worker process`.  
In that case, your images are created and container is running.

### Explore the Running Container
- Open the docker desktop app
- Click **Containers**
- There you will see the `feature-request-system` and Click That

- After that, you will see two server are running

So, you just have to click the 8000:80 ( Backend ) and 5173:80 ( Frontend )

Now you can test the applications in your browser.
